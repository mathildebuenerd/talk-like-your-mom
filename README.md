# Talk like your mom

## Description 

Allow you to write in the style of someone else.

## Usage 

Feed it with two text files as inputs, following these guidelines :
- The first file has to end with "1" and the second one with "2". _For example "input1.txt" and "input2.txt"_.
- Files should be encoded in **UTF-8**.

## Frequent errors 

If the file seems to not be loaded or not actualized, you can :
- Reload page with emptying the cache. For example with `ctrl` + `f5`.
- Check that the encoding is UTF-8, if not, resave the file.
